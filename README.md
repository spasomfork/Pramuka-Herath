I’m a software engineer who thrives on turning ideas into successful results. Over the past five years, I’ve partnered with businesses, as a freelancer and at HCL, to build custom websites and web & e-commerce applications. I like digging into real-world challenges and delivering solutions that actually matter.

At HCL, I had the chance to work on the British Petroleum project, where I managed SAP-driven processes, led IT audits, and gave analytics that lifted our team’s productivity and assisted in decision-making. Beyond software engineering, I’m passionate about crafting user experiences that convert visitors into customers and run smooth operations.

I’m a collaborative, agile-minded team player who enjoys continuous learning and driving process improvements. If you’re looking for someone who speaks both “tech” and “business” fluently while also gets things done—let’s connect.
